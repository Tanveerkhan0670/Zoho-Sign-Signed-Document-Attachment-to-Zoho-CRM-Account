# Zoho-Sign-Signed-Document-Attachment-to-Zoho-CRM-Account
This script runs on a Zoho flow workflow after a document is signed. It downloads the signed PDF, searches the related Contact in Zoho CRM using the recipient email, retrieves the linked Account, and attaches the signed document to the Account record for centralized document storage.
