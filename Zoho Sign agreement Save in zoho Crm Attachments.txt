Zoho Sign Signed Document Attachment to Zoho CRM Account

This script runs on a Zoho Sign webhook after a document is signed. It downloads the signed PDF, searches the related Contact in Zoho CRM using the recipient email, retrieves the linked Account, and attaches the signed document to the Account record for centralized document storage.



// Fetch recipient email from Zoho Sign webhook payload
actionsData = payload.getJSON("actions");
customerEmail = actionsData.getJSON("recipient_email");
info customerEmail;

// Get Zoho Sign request (document) ID
documentId = payload.getJSON("request_id");

// Download signed PDF from Zoho Sign
signedDocument = invokeurl
[
	url :"https://sign.zoho.com.au/api/v1/requests/" + documentId + "/pdf"
	type :GET
	connection:"zoho_sign"
];
info signedDocument;

// Search CRM Contact using recipient email
searchedContacts = zoho.crm.searchRecords(
	"Contacts",
	"(Email:equals:" + customerEmail + ")",
	1,
	200,
	"zoho_crm"
);

// Continue only if a matching contact is found
if(searchedContacts.size() > 0)
{
	contactData = searchedContacts.get(0);
	contactId = contactData.getJSON("id");
	accountId = contactData.getJSON("Account_Name").getJSON("id");

	// Attach signed document to the related Account
	signedDocument.setParamName("file");

	attachmentResponse = invokeurl
	[
		url :"https://www.zohoapis.com.au/crm/v6/accounts/" + accountId + "/Attachments"
		type :POST
		files:signedDocument
		connection:"zoho_crm"
	];

	info attachmentResponse;
